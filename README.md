# LevelUp Works

Welcome to Level Up Works!

This app is an elegant online solution to the problems faced by Level Up Works, an extra curricular coding school for children. It features a React.js front end coupled with Node.js and MySQL database integration for the back end. The app is designed with the student / teacher relationship in mind, and features a learning platform for children, who can work through various scratch projects at their own pace, and a progress tracking function for teachers, who can monitor the students as they learn and develop their coding skills. 

Unfortunately, this app is able to be tested via clone, as SSL keys are needed to integrate with the database which are not present in the repo, however feel free to browse the code.

*This app was created as part of the final project in the Level 4 Full Stack Development Certification attained from Mission Ready HQ and Otago Polytech in New Zealand.
